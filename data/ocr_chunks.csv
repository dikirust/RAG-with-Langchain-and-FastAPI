5,1,"Nickel Ore Mined Jan 24 was unfavorable performance against the Budget overall majority due to:
- Total material movement in Jan 24 is below than the target (actual 640 kt vs plan 1,068 kt) due to only running 6 fleet (of 8 fleet). It is caused by fuel supply (land slide), high rain fall, lack of manpower support equipment in mid Jan, and end of Jan due to DT breakdown.
- Grade of ore limonite (1.16%) above from the plan (1.10%) due to we hauled some of additional Limonite from stock in pit not hauled yet in Dec’23 (higher grade), and the saprolite’s grade actual 1.69% above from plan (1.52%) due to some of the HGLO actually mined part of HGSO.
- Saprolite ore mined is 176 kt above than plan 143 kt, due to mining sequence.
- The variance majorly cost $/tmm came from:"

- **Limonite Grade**: actual 1.14% vs plan 1.15% as mining top limonite or (~0.9Ni%) in BR1 to open up new areas
- **Saprolite grade**: actual 1.68% vs plan 1.54% as mining middle of saprolite ore body (HGSO) and due to lack of rock breaker & PC200 for bottom (LGSO) selective mining.
- The variance cost $ 0.67/t majorly came from
  - $0.32/t higher due to saprolite mine BR distance is higher than plan because exwork sap stockpile (closer to mining location is still getting hauled)"
13,2,"- $0.21/t higher recharge camp and LV due to lower tmm - production.

- **TMM actual was lower 105kt than plan 1.4m.** Contributed by JAM only 43% TMM, since insufficient support unit and operator.
- **Saprolite ore was lower than plan** due to in DS that have Saprolite planning but in actual only focus in Limonite

- **Ore Mined Sep 24 was higher against the plan (variance 1,109.6kt)** due to achievement of limonite which is three times the plan due to Hillcon add 2 fleets, additional PB 1 fleet, and effective working hours higher than plan (lower rain falls).

- **Saprolite ore was lower than plan** the lack of excavator support for selective activities is due to many support units being in breakdown.

- **Limonite grade: actual 1.20% vs plan 1.21%** due to newly opened areas which resulting in an increase in the extraction of LGLO to obtain MGLO and Saprolite. Furthermore, a portion of the LGLO is blended to produce MGLO.

58,11,"- **Ore Mined Nov 24 was higher against the plan (variance 916kt)** Achievement of ore mined was 179 % because the high achievement in ore mining is due to the reforecast, where only 12 fleets were planned, but actual running 15 fleet (DS 7 fleet BR 8 fleet).

- **Limonite grade : actual 1.19% vs plan 1.21%** additional low grade ore limonite due to top ore limonite early expose compared to model.

- **Saprolite grade: actual 1.63% vs plan 1.60%** Several areas classified as Waste / Bedrock in block model are actively mined as MGSO - HGSO, based on grade control sample.

62,12,"- **Ore Mined Dec 24 was lower the plan (variance -290kt).** Achievement of ore mined was 82% dominant caused by:
